# Belly-button-challenge


Background

In this assignment, you will build an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity datasetLinks to an external site., which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.


Had a tough time not copying and pasting sections from google/chaptgpt, used old class activities for the html but had to tweak it a lot. It's fun writing the code but when I save it and open it, you get all those errors over and over again. Or it doesn't look like the images you guys provided so I had to teak things over and over.
